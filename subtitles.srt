1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,299
 When they come in, we treat it just like one of us, okay?

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:04,780
 That's one of us.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,620
 Google, gobble, one of us.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,240
 We accept that one of us. Google, gobble, one of us.

5
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:12,279
 We accept that one of us. Google, gobble, one of us.

6
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:12,660
 Jordan!

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,619
 Your dad's coming. Something about the American Express bill?

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,940
 Can you get him out of here?

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,039
 Yeah, lick my toe.

10
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:20,239
 No, I'm serious. Get...

11
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,920
 Fuck. Okay, guys, act like we're working.

12
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:22,899
 Got any fucking stock?

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,519
 Okay, where were you? He's coming. He's coming.

14
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,140
 Make some shit up.

15
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,140
 So I think it would be short Pfizer.

16
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:33,500
 $430,000 in one month, Jordy? Huh?

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,299
 Four hundred and fucking...

18
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:38,820
 $30,000 fucking dollars in one fucking month!

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,939
 Good morning. They're business expensive. Relax.

20
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:41,740
 Business expenses?

21
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,259
 Yes.

22
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,500
 Jordy, look what you got here.

23
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:43,759
 What?

24
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,799
 Look at this. $26,000 for one fucking dinner!

25
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:49,759
 Okay, no, no, no. This could be explained.

26
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:52,320
 Dad, we had clients. We had Pfizer clients.

27
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,899
 Right, the Porter House from Argentina.

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,259
 The expensive champagne and the wine.

29
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:56,179
 We had to buy champagne.

30
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:57,840
 And you go out at all the fucking sides.

31
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,920
 Tell them about the sides, Jordy.

32
00:00:58,939 --> 00:00:59,719
 I ordered the sides, so...

33
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,679
 Sides? Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

34
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,760
 What are these sides? Did cure cancer?

35
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,000
 The sides did cure cancer. That's the problem.

36
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,599
 That's why they were expensive.

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,040
 Shut the fuck up. Stop.

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,200
 I'm serious. I know.

39
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,480
 E.J. Entertainment.

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,519
 What the fuck is E.J. Entertainment?

41
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,900
 Well, that's, uh...

42
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,019
 Yeah, Jord, what's E.J. Entertainment?

43
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:20,640
 How do I describe this?

44
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,480
 Jord, what is that?

45
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,459
 It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy.

46
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:23,819
 I know.

47
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:24,599
 That's what it is.

48
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,180
 That's... That is what it is.

49
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,060
 Isn't that the perfect description for it?

50
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,799
 That is what it is.

51
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,920
 But none of these were charged to me.

52
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:32,159
 This is all of them.

53
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,340
 Oh, that was all us.

54
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:34,260
 It wasn't me, though.

55
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:35,939
 Fucking explain this shit to him.

56
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,280
 These are all of your fucking charges right here.

57
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,319
 You guys, the IRS, they allow for T&A. It's fine.

58
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,640
 T&A. T&A.

59
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,640
 Yeah. I said T&A.

60
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,840
 No, no, you said T&A.

61
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,359
 No, I didn't.

62
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:46,980
 Yeah, you did.

63
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,879
 Why did I say that?

64
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,379
 You said T&A. It's T&A.

65
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,000
 I know you're upset about the dinner,

66
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,000
 and that makes sense because we did spend too much money,

67
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 but I said T&A.

68
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:57,019
 Don't tell me what you said. I heard what you said.

69
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:58,040
 Dad, he said T&A.

70
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,040
 He did. He said T&A.

71
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,079
 Yeah, absolutely. No question. I heard it.

72
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:01,079
 I'm trying to...

73
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,060
 I'm getting this close.

74
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,760
 I'm getting this close.

75
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:03,799


76
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,519
 That's what I'm saying.

77
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,099
 I want you to open up more, Max.

78
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,120
 He's gonna fucking kill you.

79
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
 Why do you hold it in?

80
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,120
 Why do you...

81
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,560
 Max, Max, why do you hold it in?

82
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,400
 That's it. That's it.

83
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,719
 Get the fuck out of here.

84
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,900
 No, no, no, no.

85
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,740
 Get out of here.

86
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,280
 Get out of here.

87
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:17,139
 What kind of hooker takes credit cards?

88
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,099
 A rich one.

89
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:18,960
 At Stratton.
